                    <i>‘Lost Visions: Retrieving the Visual Element of Printed Books from the Nineteenth Century’</i> is one of 21 exciting and innovative new projects funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Each project will exploit the potential of digital technologies to transform research in the arts and humanities and to ensure that it is at the forefront of tackling crucial issues such as intellectual property, cultural memory and identity, and communication and creativity in a digital age. Led by Professor Julia Thomas, from Cardiff University’s School of English, Communication and Philosophy, and in collaboration with Cardiff’s School of Computer Sciences & Informatics, Lost Visions will develop new methods to enable the general public to search online for over a million book illustrations taken from a dataset held by the British Library. The result of Thomas’s and her team’s work will be the world’s biggest searchable archive of book illustrations.

            <p>
                The starting point for the Lost Visions project was the realisation that whilst books are being digitised on an unprecedented scale, illustrations and other important visual material are frequently omitted from this process.  In cases where the illustrations have been digitised, they are often of such a low quality and lacking the metadata required to make them searchable. In a very real sense these illustrations, which are a significant aspect of our cultural heritage and play a crucial role in how we understand visual culture today, are lost. The provision of metadata for over a million illustrations from the eighteenth to the twentieth century will allow these illustrations to be searched for and retrieved in a web-based interface that will be free and accessible to the public. Furthermore, the scale and scope of the project means that Illustration Studies, as an academic discipline, will have a resource which will enable researchers to identify how, for example, illustration changes over time, how certain images are re-used in different contexts, and how texts may shift from being illustrated initially, to losing their illustrations at a later date or vice-versa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lost Visions will revolutionise how illustration is understood and the importance accorded to it.
