of mark, and he preached the new faith with a ﬁery zeal in
the district around his native town. Many still clung to the
old faith, and when preaching in Manchester, he told the’
people, “ as it were by a prophetical spirit, that, becauééﬂrey
did not readily embrace the Word of God, the mass should
be said again in the church, and the play of Rabid Hood
acted there." And in the stormy reign of Queen M'éry this
came to pass. Then came Bradford’s time of tribulation.
After about two years’ imprisonment, he was burned3 death
in Smithﬁeld, in the presence of a great multitude o ' pitying
people. Amongst them was the martyr’s brother-in-law,
Roger Bexwick, of Manchester, who tried to speak to the
martyr, but was brutally repulsed by the sheriﬁ" of Lori-don.
Bradford's last words were addressed to a boy of nineteen,
who was executed at the same time : “ Be of good comfort,
brother, for we shall have a merry supper with the Lord this
night.” The pains of death had no terror for Bradford.
“He endured the ﬂame as a fresh gale of wind on a hot

the reformed religion might enter it. Manchester has given
birth to men who have suffered and died for Protestantism;
she has also had amongst her sons those who have been
faithful unto death in their attachment to Roman Catholicism.
In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Manchester, then the home
of Bishop Chadderton, became the prison house of several
papists, whose children were trained up in the reformed
religion. James Leybourne and James Bell after imprison-
ment in this place, were both executed at Lancaster, and their
heads were set upon the steeple of the Collegiate Church
in r 58 5.
. In I 596 there came to govern the college one who was
:perhaps the most learned man of his age, and who had, not-
withstanding, a large share of the superstition of his time.
ijohn Dee was a ﬁrm believer in what we should now call spirit-
ualism, and he has left a long account of his dealings with
:the world of spirits, with whom he had, as he believed, com-
munlon through his seers, or mediums, as we should now call
them. When the death of Dee left the Warden’s ofﬁce
vacant, the man most ﬁtted for the appointment was the
Rev. William Bourne. He was a man of learning, and one of
