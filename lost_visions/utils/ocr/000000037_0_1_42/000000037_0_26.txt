in great quantity, and weaving it, returns the same again to
Ireland to sell; neither doth her industry rest here, for they
buy cotton wool in London, that comes from Cyprus and
Smyrna, and work the same into fustians, vermillons, dimities,
and ysuch other stuffs, which they return to London, where-
they are sold. ”

Humphrey Chetham, who died in 1653, was a dealer 1n, and
perhaps a manufacturer of fustians, these being one of the
earliest forms assumed here by the true cotton manufacturer.
He left money for the endowment of the blue coat school and
public library, which bears his name. About this time
Manchester was described as being “ one mile in length,
with good streets and buildings, and the people more
industrious than in any other part of the north of England.”
In 1750 the cotton trade began to be imported into Manchester,
and ten years later the foreign markets began to be supplied
with Manchester cotton goods. It was about this time that
gr. Iohn Ka y,of Bury, invented the “picking peg.” The

uke of Bridygewater and the engineer Brindley, in 1758
commenced making the “ Bridgewater canal” which
created a complete revolution in the transit of goods.
It was completed at a cost of [220,000 some years
afterwards. In 1779 the “spinning mule " was invented
by Samuel Crompton, and in the same year, serious.
riots occurred in Manchester, and indeed throughout Lan-
cashire, against the introduction of the new machinery for
spinning. Power-loom spinning was patented in 1785 by
Dr. E. Cartwright. In the same year, cylindrical calico-print-
ing was invented by Bell. At this time Pitt estimated the
population employed in the cotton trade at 80,000. There
were in 1787 only forty- two spinning factories 1n all Lanca-
shire. Steam engines were ﬁrst introduced into Lancashire
cotton factories 1n the same year, and muslin manufactures
began to rise into notice. It was not till 1806 that the power-
loom became recognized as a' successful invention. Two
years before‘ Arkwright’s steam machinery was intro llced
for the carding and spinning of cotton, only 5,198,778 1 s. of'
cotton- wool were imported. The switching machine was
introduced into Manchester in I809, and in the following year
Mr. Wright invented the “ double mule.”

In 182 5 the silk trade began to ﬂorish here ; and Roberts’s.
self-acting mule, the one now in general use, was ﬁrst patented.
