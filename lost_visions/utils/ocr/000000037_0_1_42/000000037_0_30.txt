later period belongs the “ Red Rover ” stage coach, which is
shown in a drawing made in 1823, passing along Market Street.

The printing ofﬁce of Wilmot Henry Jones is worth
mention as the place where the ﬁrst edition of Bailey’s
“ Festus" was printed.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

RED ROVER ” STAGE COACH 1N MARKET STREET, 1823.

The great line of demarcation between old and New
Manchester was in 1821, when the Act for the widening of
Market- street was obtained. The improvements then com-
menced occupied several years. The principal street of the
town before that time was the narrow thoroughfare here
shown.

Many quaint old fashioned buildings still remained,
especially in the neighbourhood of the old church. Thus
there were very picturesque houses in Smithy Door.

Just on the other side of the church many antique
structures remained in Long Millgate.

Here stood the ofﬁcial home of the Archididasculus of the
Grammar School. In this house lived Mr. Charles Lawson,
the learned master, under whose sway De Quincey passed
his unhappy schoolboy- days.
