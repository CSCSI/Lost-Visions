and prosperity of the hamlet of A-ncoats, enjoyed many
pleasant hours of mirth and sport. For 260 years Ancoats,
Hall was a seat of the Mosley family, who were lords of the,
manor of Manchester. Here the restoration of. Charles II. '*
was celebrated in great style. A century ago—1n 1786—Sir f
John Parker Mosley was High Sheriff of the county, and his
appointment was celebrated by a grand ball and precession.
The district is also associated with the names of Henry
Liverseege, Charles Swain, Sir William F airbairn, William 9,
Hepworth Dixon, and other Manchester worthies. W

There is very little left now of old Manchester and Salford, 3
but there are still a few houses in Greengate, Shudehill, and
Long Millgate. A fragment is standing of Garratt Old Hall.
After the relic of the Roman wall, which is not visible to the ,
public, the oldest historic ground is that on which stands
Chetham's Hospital. It is the strangest sight we have in Man-
chester, so strongly does it contrast with the present. The
streets are all alive : cabs dash by, containing dilatory persons
who are doomed to pay double fares for speed, and to miss the ..
train at last. Victoria Street is crowded with foot passengers,
hansoms, trams, lurries, and perambulators. You are pushed
along in a crowd of lawyers’ clerks, bricklayers, elderly
ladies, and business men of every description. You are
borne along in the hurrying stream, when, by a sudden
effort, you tear yourself from the human wave that is bearing
you onward, and ﬁnd yourself in the peaceful haven beyond
the arched gateway of Chetham’s Hospital. As at the touch
of some enchanter’s wand the present vanishes; the toiling,
struggling, ever busy city disappears as though it were a
thousand miles away. We are in the olden time. The long
low building that stands before us, weather-stained and
storm-beaten, yet strong, ﬁrm, and sound, is one of the few
relics left us of the thriving Village that stood by Irk and
Irwell when their streams were still clear and bright, and
sparkled with the swift ﬂash of the ﬁshes as they passed,
How many generations of men have fumed and fretted their
little hour upon the stage of life and passed on to the silent
Godsacre since these walls were ﬁrst reared?
