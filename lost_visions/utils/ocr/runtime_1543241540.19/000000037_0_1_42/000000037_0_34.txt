irritable parsbn and the irritable poet. Joshua was not indie
posed to recognize jocularity in others. Thus a waggish
articled pupil of a Solicitor once took a seat in the minister’s
pew in the old church. The rough chaplain coming told
him in sharp tones that it was reserved for parsons and

clerks. “ Well, sir, I’m a clerk.” “ Eh, what! what

town itself the School mills had a monopoly of the grinding
of corn until 1759. The tenants were nicknamed Bone and
Skin, being thin men, and witty Dr. Byrom thus expostulated

Bone and Skin, two millers thin,
Would starve the town, or near it ;

But be it known to Skin and Bone

On the 15th November, 1757, the country people came from
