his texts were Gen. i. i., and Rev. xxii. xx , so that he got

The Manchester of those olden days contained about a
dozen streets and a single church. The condition of the town
may be gathered ‘ from the orders framed for its good
government by the Court Leet Jury. Some of the provisions
of the old Court Leet for the market are of a kind
to excite a smile by the contrast they suggest with the
present order of things. In I 5 58 an order was made for the
removal of a “swine cote ” standing in the Market Stead
Lane, whilst the‘butchers selling ﬂesh are ordered to cleanse
the street from the “horns, or such like ﬁlth,” with which
they soiled it. The holders of the stalls who could not keep
them clean were to pay quarterly a penny to those appointed
for the task. The ofﬁcers of the Court Leet had no easy task
in attempting to enforce the rules. In I 564 there were “four
market lookers ” to superintend the sale of corn, two for ﬁsh,
and two for ﬂesh; four for white meat, and two ale-conners,
not to mention the “ mise gatherers,” “ aﬂ'eerators," and
other ofﬁcers. ' Later there was a town swineherd and an
“ overseer for fruit." One rule which perplexed these
worthies to enforce was a mysterious injunction that no'
butter or suet should be put in cakes. The motives for this
prohibition are unknown, and even when the Court Leet had
twelve ofﬁcers to look after its strict enforcement the rule was
disregarded. The paternal kindness with which the liberty
of choice was denied in the most trivial matters is a striking
feature of the old times. Many a merry troop of lads and
lasses who have frolicked through the old market place must
have grumbled at these well-meant restraints as to wedding
feasts. The Court Leet orderded that at these wedding
dinners, for the beneﬁt of the new-married pairs, not more
than 4d. a head should be paid.

In I 586 it was strictly ordered that no “ stranger,” La,
person not living in the town, should be allowed to buy
apples or other fruit before nine in the morning, and “ that
they shall not retail any being bought the same day." Lest
this should be evaded by some townsmen using his good
ofﬁces, “ the jury also do order that no inhabitant within the
town shall buy any apples or other fruit and sell them by
wholesale of the same day; or by any colour do buy for any
stranger, on pain to forfeit the same apples, &c., two parts of
