retainers of the Baron of Manchegter, doubtless followed him
to the crusade. The ﬁrst blood of the civil wars was shed in
this town. Manchester was besieged by the royalists during
the civil war, but the assailants under Lord Strange, after-
wards the seventh Earl of Derby, were defeated. The town
was strongly_republican in those days, and the town was a
place of refuge for the Puritans. Lancashire in the main
sided with theparliament, and by the midsummer of 1643
the royalists, under Lord Derby, had been driven out of the
county, and every fortiﬁed place in Lancashire except
Lathom was in the hands of the Puritans. Yet there were
brave hearts in Manchester that beat high in mistaken loyalty
for the King, and when in 1651 the Parliament issued a
proclamation against that Charles Stuart, who was after-
wards King of England, Captain Bexw1cke indignantly tore
it into pieces as it was being publicly read. The Jacobite
feeling in the district was strong during the reign of VVllliam
III. In 1694. there was a great trlal at Manchester of
Lancashire gentlemen, who were charged with being con-
cerned in a plot for bringing back the exiled James. When
the exiled Stuarts sought to regain the throne they found
ardent followers in Manchester, who gave up their lives and
fortunes in mistaken loyalty to the Stuarts. The story of the
“ Manchester Rebels” is told in one of Ainsworth’s novels.
The Manchester of 1750 was a place so different from the
Manchester of to-day, that if any inhabitants of the old place
could revisit their old home they would imagine themselves
to be in fairyland. There has been a new earth. if not a new
heaven, since that far-oil day. The streets were few, narrow
and tortuous. Market Street was a quaint old alley. Its
houses of overhanging gables were so close, that, when a broad-
wheeled waggon was dragging along, the pedestrian had to
exercise both patience and ingenuity to avoid destruction.
The edge of the town was reached long before the site of the
present inﬁrmary. There stood the waste land in which was
the pool of water known as the Daubholes, wherein scolding
women were ducked, in that old-fashioned instrument of
torture known as the ducking stool. About the pond stretched
green trees, with here and there a cottage. Almost opposite
was the pleasant home of the Lever family, an old-fashioned
mansion of white and black. Ardwick was a pretty village
separated from Manchester by a mile of pleasant country
