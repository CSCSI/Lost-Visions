The oldest Manchester prison was simply a dungeon on
Salford Bridge. This was replaced later by a House of
Correction at Hunt's Bank.

The old House of Correction was visited in 1774. by the
famous John Howard. The keeper was a chandler, who
employed some of the prisoners in making candlewick at
three half-pence a pound. His salary was raised from [60
to £80 on giving up the farming of the tap. The number of
prisoners at one time varied from six to 51. When, in
1787, a new prison was erected, it was arranged according to
the plans of John Howard, whose name was on the founda-
tion-stone. This also has passed away.

It the year 1750 some progressive spirit thought that
Manchester was now large and rich enough to support a
stand of hackney coaches, and accordingly they were
stationed in St. Ann’s Square, then as now a place of resort
for the belles and beaux of the town. There were not
enough of patrons to ﬁnd employment for this solitary cab-
stand, and it had to be given up, after its promoters had lost
money by it, and the belles of old Manchester again tramped

streets. It was not until 1810 that the hackney-stands were
organized.

As late as 1770 the letters were brought from London in
bags three times a week by a post boy on a half-starved horse.
The delivery of the letters was effected each day by an old
man and his wife, who delivered the letters of the entire town.

The news of the battle of Waterloo was brought to Man~
chester by a stout rider, Mr. John Pooley, who rode from
London to this town in seventeen hours, and making his way
to the Manchester Exchange, toil~worn and travel-stained,
put the Gazette Extraordinary into the hands of Francis
Philips, who read out the news to the delighted hearers.

In 1773 it was advertised that the Manchester, Warrington,
and Liverpool stage coach would set out from the Spread
Eagle, in Salford, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in
every week, and returned thither on Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday. Lest the terrors of the journey should be too much
they were assured the travellers would meet with friendly
