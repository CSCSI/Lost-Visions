This was the last of the few remarkable inventions by which
the cotton trade has grown to its greatness.

The busiest part of old Manchester is shown in this view.
The Market Place, with the Exchange (the second structure
of the kind), the Post Ofﬁce, market stalls, &c. Besides its
uses as a meeting place for the merchants, the Exchange was
a place for public meetings and theatrical entertainments.
When the ﬁrst Exchange was built companies of actors
visited the town, coming from London and Dublin, and gave
plays, whilst they charged for concerts. This was to evade
the Dramatic Licence Act. The Theatre Royal was built in
Spring Gardens in 1775, after much opposition. The poor
players were burnt out of their house in 1789, and it is feared
that it was not the result of an accident, but the work of some
fanatic who saw in the Theatre only possibilities of evil, and

military rule into his conduct of this house. At eight
o’clock each night John walked into the room to his
assembled guests, and proclaimed, “ Eight o’clock, gentle-
men; eight o'clock.” If this intimation was not promptly
responded to by the ﬁling out of his customers, John would
crack a heavy hqgsewhip in suggestive proximity to those
still lingering oven their potations. As a ﬁnal resource, the
stout servant Molly was called, and immediately ﬂooded the
ﬂoor with water from her pail preparatory to giving it its
nightly scrubbing. One election day the successful candi-
date, Colonel Stanley, pleaded with John for liberty to
have another bowl of punch after the fatal hour had struck
The reply was characteristic. “ Colonel Stanley, you are a
