The old market was a place of prompt punishment. The
stocks and pillory stood there for centuries. An anecdote is
told of a man who had been placed in the stocks for drunken-

1812. Our ungallant ancestors also made free use of the

again to the spacious times of great Elizabeth it was ordered
that no single woman should be allowed to keep house or
chamber within the town.

The dogs roaming about the streets were a source of great

Then there was a mysterious order which prohibited the

Saturdays. The chief source of the water supply was by a
conduit, and the key was in the keeping of one man, and it
was only by his agency that water could be drawn at all, and
then he was to be reasonably recompensed. Further, no one
was to be allowed to wash at the conduit.

John Taylor, the water poet, has left a curious account of
his visit to Manchester.

The “ Eagle and Child " was afterwards known as the old
Coffee House, and is the end house on the right hand side ot
the View here given.

Manchester people have always had a good opinion of their
own courage. There was an old conceit that the name of the
town meant the city of men, and was given as an indication of
their valour. Manchester, doubtless, sent its share of low
men to the hard fought ﬁeld of middle ages, some of the
