acorns, beans, chopped straw and still more offensive in—
gredients. A local poet has thus sung of the famous ﬁght of
Shudehill—

And with vows of destruction the mob came to blows;
Attacked the poor dealers and plundered their shops

Of their meal and their ﬂour, their potatoes and hops.

The soldiers were mustered—with a justice their head-—
The muskets were loaded, the Riot Act read ;

When, alarmed for his safety, with fear, pale, and haggered,
The justice commanded, “ Advance two steps backward !”

This farce was unfortunately only the prelude of a tragedy.
The mob, full of anger, commenced to stone the soldiers, and
when one of these had been killed and nine injured,they ﬁred
upon the people. Three of the rioters were killed and more
wounded. The wounded men we may suppose would be-
taken to the Inﬁrmary.

When the Inﬁrmary was founded in 1752, it was quite on
the outskirts of the town, and even in 1815 its appearance,
as shown in the engraving, is quite suburban.

In 1822 there was for one year a small settlement of rocks
in three Lombardy poplar trees, which then stood in a small
court at the angles of Chancery Lane and Brown Street.
The noise of the bricklayers did not scare away the birds,
who calmly held possession of Mrs. Hall‘s trees for one season,
but never returned. It was the “ Farewell, Manchester,"
they sang in their hoarse caws. Fifty years earlier there
were rookeries at Hulme Hall, in Quay Street, at Hunt's.
Bank, at Rood’s Gutter in Long Millgate, and at Shudehill.

Round about Manchester were old halls, the residences of
ancient families or rich traders. The Assize Courts now
cover the site of the house and grounds of Strangeways Hall,
once the home of the popular Col. Joseph Hanson, the
“' Weaver’s Friend,” who was imprisoned for taking part
with the operatives in a labour dispute.

Of still greater interest is Ancoats Hall, where the Man-
chester Art Museum is now placed. The present building
occupies the site of a more ancient pile.

Ancoats has been connected with the industry of Man-
chester for six ’centuries. At the close of the thirteenth
century Robert, the son of Robert, the son of Simon Tinctore
de Mamecestre, gave two ridges of his land in Ancoats to
