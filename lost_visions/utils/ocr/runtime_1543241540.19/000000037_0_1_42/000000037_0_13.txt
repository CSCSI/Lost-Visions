certain day in May, in 14.22, when the necessary license had
been obtained, the people were gathered together by the
sound of the church bell to witness and give their consent
to the church being collegiated. There were Sirrjohn le .
Byron and Sir John de Radcliffe; there were rafford,.
Booth, Strangewayes and Hulme, Prestwich and Barlow,
and many more Manchester gentlemen there present to
witness Thomas la Warre make a déed of gift of his
lands and rectory of Manchester to Thomas, Lord Bishop
of Durham, who founded a collegiate church in honour
of the Virgin Mary, of St. Denis of France, and of St.
George, of merry England. Thus it was that the Baron’s
Hall came to be the home of the Guild of the Blessed Virgin,
with its warden, fellows, and singing men, to whom there
were occasional additions of chantry priests. Here they ate
their food, read and sang the services of the church, and
quarrelled, no doubt, to kill time in monastic fashion. That
they were not unmindful of the goad things of this world we
know, for they rented the park of Nether Aldport, and had
the right of ﬁshing in the Irk. One of them, for pleasant
meditation, had a pit near High Knolls planted with a double
edge and graced by seats. Two centuries after the good
priest was dust, this was known as Sir John Browne's pit.
The baronial character of the buildings are best seen from
the river Irk.

One of the earlywardens was Stanley, afterwards Bishop of
Ely. In I496 he was living in Paris, and vainly endeavoured
to bribe Erasmus to become his teacher. The cause of his
anxiety was that he had been promised a bishopric, but was
not sufﬁciently learned for the episcopal position. Whether
the learning came there is nothing to show, but the bishopric
of Ely was given to him. He has been described as more
voluptuous than virtuous. Like all priests, he had taken the
vow of celibacy, but his son, Sir John Stanley, fought at
Flodden Field. There might well be scandal concerning his
fair dwelling-house at St. Ives. He was, as we have seen, of
noble birth, was not overstocked with learning. but stately,
hospitable, and generous. Amidst the grandeur of his
episcopal home his thoughts turned to his old abode, and

He did end his life in merry Manchester,
And right honourably lieth he buried there.

The greatest ecclesiastic connected (with our city was Hugh.
