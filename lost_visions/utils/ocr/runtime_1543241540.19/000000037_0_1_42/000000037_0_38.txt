the Smithy stede, the Kilnelands, the Stonigate, the Walbanc,
and the Ringherd de Shorteys, and Ellendeye. The family
which took its name from Ancoats was not the only one that
had extensive possessions in the district.

In I 331, Henry, son of Robert de Ancotes. lets his land in
the .hamlet to Sir Robert de Burun for a term of forty years,
the rent being one rose.’ This Sir Robert was a knight of
the shire for the county of Lincoln. Next year the letting
was converted into a gift. , In the ﬁfteenth century the
family of De Holinworth had property in Ancoats, and there
are numerous deeds of transfers and re-transfers apparently
executed with a View to making the title as certain as the
cumbrous legal machinery of the day would allow. Their
connection with Ancoats lasted from 1428. to 14 56, when the
land and tenements were in possession partly of l{ohm Byron
of Clayton, and partly of Bartin Trafford. T us we ﬁnd
that towards the end of the ﬁfteenth century the ancient
owners of the land had been replaced by members of those
two powerful local families, the Byrons and the Traffords.
The rental of the manor of Manchester in 1472 shows that
John Byron and Bartrinus Trafford each paid 35. 4d. yearly
rent, and were further under obligation to grind their grain
at the mill belonging to the lord of the manor of Manchester.
In the sixteenth century Lord la Warre held the hamlet of
Ancoats, and amongst those who had possessions in it were
Sir Edmund Traﬂord, Edmund Entwysell, and John Byron.

Let us try to imagine what this district must have been in
the distant past. The town of Manchester would be separated
by stretches of woodland and ﬁelds from the little hamlet of
Ancoats, which had its messuages and orchards, its green
lanes leading to the rural bridge over the then clear bright
stream of the Medlock. There was a Stonygate, and Stony-
lands, the cause of grief to the agriculturalist ; there were the
'Claycroft and the Kiln-lands in suggestive proximity. There
was the Wallbank, Longmere, the Hardacre, the Knoll, the
Shortcroft, the Middlecroft, the Bridge furlong, and the
Smithy Stead. There was the Waste of Elendeye, and
a mysterious locality called the Ringherd del Shorteys.
Lastly there was the Broad Green. Here we may hope that
those who helped the dyers of Manchester, who tended the
orchards and farms of the squires, who worked in the kiln-
Jands, and who in all other ways contributed to the wealth
