those earnest God-fearing men in whom some of the best
aspects of Puritanism are to be seen. His life was answer-
able to his professions. and hence the people had faith in
him, so that his judgment was almost a law to them. In the
year 1605 the Angel of Death reaped a heavy harvest in the
then little town. The pestilence broke out in the narrow
wynds and tortuous passages of the town. One ﬁfth of the
inhabitants died. Bourne was not one of those fair-weather
friends, but clung to his post in the fever-stricken town,
preaching and exhorting until the mob became unruly in
the presence of death, and then he went and preached in a
ﬁeld near to Shooter’s brook—about Bank Top—the towns-
people being on one side of him and the country people on
the other. Bourne’s piety was so well known that if we may
believe the gossip of the time the very devils were afraid of him.
A certain tailor in Manchester met a man who asked him
to make a suit of clothes. Something aroused the tailor’s
suspicions, and he conﬁded to Mr. Bourne his belief that
the unknown customer was no less than the Devil! The
parson’s advice was that he should cut out the cloth
upon a sheet of paper, and be particularly careful not to
lose even a shred. At the appointed time the tailor took
the clothes to the appointed spot, good Mr. Bourne remaining
in the distance to watch progress. The devil in the likeness
of a man came according to promise, and when he received
his suit he exclaimed 2—“ Oh, yonder is Bourne, thy holy
father who hath instructed thee what to do !” So he vanished,
it is gratifying to know, without having done any harm to the
poor tailor.

Neither Boume's piety nor his ability, nor the recognition
of his power to frighten even the devil, served to place him
in the warden’s seat. The oﬂice was given to a Scotchman,
named Murray. of whose arrogance there are some curious
evidences. He once preached before King James, from Rom. i.
xvi., “ I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.” When he
came after the service to kiss the King’s hands, James, with
more truth than politeness said “ Thou art not ashamed of
the gospel of Christ, but the gospel of Christ may well be
ashamed of thee." Murray was of an avaricious and suspic—
ious nature. and lived in continual dread of poison, so that
his servants were forced to taste of each dish before he would
eat or drink. He preached only twice in Manchester, and
